## More about me
I am a full-stack developer based in St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador currently learning react-native and Unity Game Engine. I have over 2 years of experience in full stack development, made over 700+ commits on [GitHub](https://github.com/adisagar2003) and contributed to over five well known institutions/companies. I like to go ahead and work with MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and React with ChakraUI. I focus on delivering industrial standard web apps quickly and always try to make my apps more competent with the biggest web-apps of the industry. Currently I am learning NEXTJS and JamStack with PostgreSQL. I am also a hobbyist game dev working on a survival horror game at night.
