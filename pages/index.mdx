# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer based in St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador currently learning react-native and Unity Game Engine. I have over 2 years of experience in full stack development, made over 700+ commits on [GitHub](https://github.com/adisagar2003) and contributed to over five well known institutions/companies. 

## Previous Experience

import Card from '../components/card';
import { PROJECTS } from '../data/PROJECTS';




<div className={"projectsContainer"} >
{PROJECTS.map((project)=>{
  return (
    <Card projectStars={project.projectStars} liveLink={project.liveLink} gitHubLink={project.liveLink} projectName={project.projectName} projectDescription={project.projectDescription} />
  )
})}
</div>
